The sarcosuchus is a ancient crocodile, it was around 35-40 meters long. It weighed around 3-4 tons, a car weighs 1+ tons. It lived during after the jurrasic period, they were able to take down some of the apex predators, such as the trex, making them a apex creature too.
even tho they were giant crocodilians, they were not the biggest, the deinosuchus unfortuently takes the spot for the first.
